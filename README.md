# utopian_project_Recommend Me a Movie

# Overview
This project aims to build a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system will analyze user preferences and past interactions to recommend movies that users are likely to enjoy. <font size="6">

  
# Description
In the era of abundant entertainment options, personalized movie recommendations play a crucial role in enhancing user experience and engagement. This project aims to analyze watching frequency and preference data from Netflix users to build a model of audience preference with the output of movie suggestions so that users do not need to waste time browsing through movies that they have no interest. In this project, we will develop a robust movie recommendation system leveraging collaborative filtering techniques to provide tailored movie suggestions to users based on their preferences and past interactions.

# Contributions
- Shan: Created project title and provided description and objectives of the project. Designed and implemented the user interface for the application. This involved creating intuitive screens for users to input their preferences and view recommended movies.
- Jeremy: Found and properly cited references and resources.  Developed the core algorithm for movie recommendations based on user preferences. This included selecting the appropriate machine learning model and training it with a dataset of movie ratings.
- Jihan: Logged contributions made by each member and challenges faced while creating this project. Managed the project's code repository, ensuring that all contributions were merged successfully and handled version control. Also set up the project structure in GitHub, including branches for development, testing, and production.

# Challenges
- Project Ideation: used references and resources online.
- Unfamiliarity with git and GitHub: referred to course slides and google search.
- Command Line Text Editor: researched on google and used nano on mac terminal.
- Data Acquisition: Sourcing a comprehensive and reliable movie dataset was a challenge. We explored various APIs such as IMDb and The Movie Database (TMDb) and decided to use TMDb due to its extensive documentation and ease of use.
- Algorithm Optimization: Balancing the accuracy of recommendations with computational efficiency was tricky. We experimented with several machine learning models and tuning their parameters before settling on a hybrid approach that combined content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.
