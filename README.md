# Description
In the era of abundant entertainment options, personalized movie recommendations play a crucial role in enhancing user experience and engagement. This project aims to analyze watching frequency and preference data from Netflix users to build a model of audience preference with the output of movie suggestions so that users do not need to waste time browsing through movies that they have no interest. In this project, we will develop a robust movie recommendation system leveraging collaborative filtering techniques to provide tailored movie suggestions to users based on their preferences and past interactions.
